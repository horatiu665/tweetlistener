# Basic Twitter API

Searching is done using Twitter API v1.1, which requires some sort of authentication, so search queries cannot be performed by just anyone and with some limits.

There is a freemium service http://tweetreach.com/ that allows limited queries, it was recommended in this tutorial (https://unionmetrics.com/resources/how-to-use-advanced-twitter-search-queries/) as a test when creating queries to see if the results are valid/similar/etc. The tutorial offers helpful tips for searching various things such as by language, by location, and/or/not, by account.

Also obvious choice for testing queries is the actual twitter search function https://twitter.com/search-home though it behaves slightly different than the queries using REST or Streaming.

Another useful service is the console dev app, https://dev.twitter.com/rest/tools/console which allows queries to be performed with actual results shown in return.
