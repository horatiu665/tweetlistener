# Cloud idea

In order to cover more ground and gather larger amounts of data than is currently possible, a cloud solution is sought.

## AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers scalable cloud computing and storage solutions. The simplest step seems to be creating a [free account which offers some amount of free usage](http://aws.amazon.com/free/), however it can only be used by providing credit card/bank account details, and preparing to be billed unexpectedly by exceeding the free limits of the service. A big nasty [thread states that there is apparently no service for limiting the budget for AWS](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=58127) since a few years ago, and therefore it is possible that without great care, the price of services used can skyrocket (since services are scalable automatically, and even tests/tutorial projects are billed).

## Microsoft Azure

Azure offers the billing limit mentioned above, called [spending limit](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/spending-limits/), and it simply shuts down services when the prices exceed the specified limit. This allows for tests and debug sessions without risk of spending ridiculous amounts by mistake. Therefore this makes it possible to test the deployment of applications on the server.

[Azure offers a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) which affords $ 200 for testing purposes for the first month. There is a possibility for free service for students. <will investigate more>
