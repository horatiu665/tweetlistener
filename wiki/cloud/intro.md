# Cloud idea

In order to cover more ground and gather larger amounts of data than is currently possible, a cloud solution is sought.

## AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers scalable cloud computing and storage solutions. The simplest step seems to be creating a [free account which offers some amount of free usage](http://aws.amazon.com/free/), however it can only be used by providing credit card/bank account details, and preparing to be billed unexpectedly by exceeding the free limits of the service. A big nasty [thread states that there is apparently no service for limiting the budget for AWS](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=58127) since a few years ago, and therefore it is possible that without great care, the price of services used can skyrocket (since services are scalable automatically, and even tests/tutorial projects are billed).
