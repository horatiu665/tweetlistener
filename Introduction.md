The TweetListener app is aimed at becoming a simple solution for datamining Twitter data, for use in research. Specifically, the research is aimed at the dynamics of the public discussing games in relation to games' release dates.

Current goals include creating a user-friendly tool for setting up the Tweet stream, and giving the option for a long-term connection which continuously feeds data into a database. As a long-term goal, the tool should be customizable enough to be able to connect in multiple ways for various purposes.

Future goals include query expansion and mechanisms for gathering all or most data relevant to a specific subject, such as all tweets related to the game Call Of Duty (as an example), and also features for data analysis.
